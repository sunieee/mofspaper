& Metal–Organic Frameworks Redox-Active Metal–Organic Frameworks: HighlyStable ChargeSeparated States through Strut/Guest-to-StrutElectron Transfer Nivedita Sikdar, [a] Kolleboyina Jayaramulu, [a] VenkayalaKiran, [b] K. Venkata Rao, [c] Srinivasan Sampath, [b] Subi J. George,* [c] and Tapas Kumar Maji* [a, c] Abstract: Molecular organization of donor and acceptor chromophores in self-assembled materials is of paramount interestinthe field of photovoltaics or mimicry of natural light-harvesting systems. With this in mind, aredox-active porousinterpenetratedmetal–organic framework (MOF), {[Cd(bpdc)(bpNDI)]·4.5 H 2 O·DMF} n (1)has been constructed from amixed chromophoric system.The m-oxo-bridged secondary building unit, {Cd 2 (m-OCO) 2 }, guidesthe parallel alignment of bpNDI (N,N’-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide) acceptorlinkers, whichare tetheredwith bpdc (bpdcH 2 = 4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid) linkers of another entangled net in the framework, resulting in photochromic behaviour through inter-net electron transfer .E ncapsulationofelectron-donating aromatic molecules in the electron-deficient channels of 1 leads to aperfect donor– acceptor co-facial organization, resulting in long-lived charge-separated states of bpNDI.Furthermore, 1 and guest encapsulated species are characterised through electrochemical studiesfor understanding of their redox properties.
The spatial organization of organic chromophores in self-assembled scaffolds is important for understanding and controlling the processes in artificial light-harvestingsystems and in variousoptoelectronic devices.
[1] However,the developmentof such supramolecular organizations that can harvest visible light and guide excitation energyorelectron transfer in acontrolled manner impose areal challenge.Recently,the perception of photofunctional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with chromophoric linkers as an organised matrix of light harvesters has movedtothe fore.
[2] The concept of crystal engineering and reticular chemistry based on predesigned organiclinkers and secondary buildingunits (SBU) allows the desired spatial organization of organic chromophores in MOFs and, hence, the intermolecular distances and angles between the organic linkerscan be controlled.
[3] MOFs have already drawnsubstantial attention for their potentialapplicationsinseveral fields, such as gas storage,separation, catalysis and drug delivery, based on their permanent porosity.
[4] However,the well-defined nanopores provide additionaldesign potentialfor incorporating chromophoric guest molecules to modulate the photophysical processes.
[5] This design has been extensively used for light harvesting in MOFs with tuneable luminescent properties.
[2a,e,5c] On the otherhand, redox-active multichromophoricframeworks that exhibit electron transfer between the linkersorwith guest molecules have been underexplored.
Such adesign would give extended donor–acceptor arrays with specific organization,whichwould exhibit interesting charge-transport or ferroelectricproperties or mayact as shape-selectivesensors.
[6] Although co-facial donor–acceptor assemblies, which often lead to partial charge-transfer complexes, are well studied, achieving complete electrontransfer requiresbetter control of the spatial organization of the molecularcomponents.
[1c] In this respect, we envisaged that mixedchromophoric MOFs can be useful for grafting suitable donors (D) and acceptors (A) with long range order.Entanglement of frameworks would be one of the strategies for achieving closecontacts of Dand Achromophoric linkers to realise photoinduced chargeorelectron transfer.
For this purpose, we have turned our attention to the aromatic redox-active naphthalenediimides (NDIs).NDIs are planar, chemically robust andeasily reducible molecules that have been utilised as efficient electron-accepting chromophores (n-type) in different applications,such as in photosynthesis, solar energy conversion, electrochromic devices,molecular electronics, and as photochromic materials.
[7] We have chosen apyridine-substituted NDI derivative, that is, bpNDI (N,N’-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide) as the pillar [8] and bpdcH 2 (4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid) as the linker for the construction of anovel redox-active framework {[Cd(bpdc)(bpNDI)]·4.5 H 2 O·DMF} n (1), which is atwofold interpenetrated 3D multichromophoric porous framework. In this communication, we show that this framework exhibits unique photochromic behaviour resulting from the long-lived chargeseparated chromophores, as aresult of inter-net strut-to-strut electron transfer (Scheme 1).

electron-rich guest molecules [for example, 1,5-/2,6-dinaphthol (1,5/2,6-DAN) and 4,N,N-trimethylaniline (DMPT)] into the electron-deficient channels of this framework leads to very stable charge-separated states in the ground state. Although, NDI and dinaphthols are awell-known charge-transfer pair, [7f, g] this is the first report of the incorporation of them into aMOF that results in the formation of ahighly stable bpNDI radical anion by complete electron transfer.
The compound 1 was synthesised by using solvothermal conditions and single-crystalX-ray diffraction analysissuggests that 1 crystallises in the monoclinic P2 1 /n space group. The Cd II metal centre is heptacoordinated and two such metal centres form a{Cd 2 (m 2 -OCO) 2 } n SBUand these SBUs are connected by bpdc linkerstoform an extended 2D rhombic network along the (101 ¯ )plane (Figure 1a). This 2D layer is furtherbipillared by bpNDI linkers to form a(2,8)-cconnected 3D framework structure (Figure 1b). It is worth mentioningthat the m 2 -oxo bridgeddinuclearSBU ensures the two bpNDI units stack in aface-to-facefashion (cg···cg distance 3.844 æ), resulting in abipillared layer framework. The NDI cores of the pillar bpNDI linkers maintain the perfect parallel arrangement with respect to each other (the dihedralangle between the NDI cores is 08).
However,the pyridine ring of bpNDI is not in the same plane as the NDI core and the corresponding tilting angle between them is 58.328.Moreover,the presence of long linkersresults in alarge void space in the 3D net and, hence, induces twofold interpenetration in the framework (Figure 1c). Upon interpenetration, the framework shows a1Drectangular channel with dimensionsof6.4Õ7.1 æ 2 along the [101 ¯ ]d irectio n( Figure 1d ); the channel is filledwith guest water and DMF molecules.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the guest molecules are removed in astepwise manner (in the temperature range 55–240 8C, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) and the desolvated state of 1 (1’)remains stable up to 345 8C.
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of 1’ (Figure2a) shows no distinct change compared with that of 1,suggesting arobust natureofthe framework. As seen from the single-crystal structure, 1 contains ahigh amount of void space, but it does not show anyN 2 uptakeat77K (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This might be due to the low thermal energyofthe adsorbate relative to the high diffusion barrieras the framework contains a1Dchannel structure.
[9] However, CO 2 adsorption measurements at 195 Kshowedatypical typeI profile (Figure 2b and Figure S2), unveiling the microporous nature of the framework. The saturated CO 2 uptake is 92 cm 3 g ¢1 (18 wt %, 3.2 CO 2 molecules per formula unit), which corresponds to aLangmuir surface area of 286 m 2 g ¢1 . 1’ is also able to capture CO 2 at 298 Katarelatively high value of 34 cm 3 g ¢1 (6.8 wt %, 1.1 CO 2 per formula unit;Figure S2). The uptakeofCO 2 in 1’ can be accounted for by the quadrupolar nature of the CO 2 molecules (quadrupolemomentofCO 2 : 4.3Õ10 26 esu ¢1 cm ¢2 ), which interactwith the pendent carbonyl oxygen atoms of the bpNDIpillarsthat are aligned along the pore surface.

The compound 1 shows broad absorption in the range of 200–400nm, characteristic of typical p–p*and n–p*transitions. The presence of avery weak band in the visible region (400–600nm) corresponds to p-stacked bpNDI chromophores, as is evident in the crystal structure as well. The origin of this band is further confirmed by the solution-state self-assembly studies of bpNDI chromophores in DMF/water solvent mixtures. Ahigherpercentage of water induced aggregation of these chromophores, which resultedinsimilarfeatures in absorptionbands (FigureS3inthe Supporting Information). We furtherstudied the photophysical responses of this framework upon exposure to UV-light irradiation, where two chromophores of different electronic nature are parts of the integrated framework. Interestingly,shinning UV light (365 nm) for as little as 20–30 soncrystals of 1 resulted in an immediate drastic colour change (Figure 3a and Figure S4 in the SupportingInformation)from golden yellow to dark brown, while the crystal structure remained intact as supported by the PXRD pattern (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The colourofthese crystalswas reverted to yellow by keeping them in air for 7to 8h(Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The UV/Vis spectra of irradiated crystals of 1 showedthe appearance of new bands with maxima at 478, 617, 737 and 821 nm, the intensity of which increases on longer exposure to UV light (Figure 3c).
The possible origin of these peaks is the formation of radical anions of the bpNDI linker molecules (see below). The formation of the radical anionisfurtherconfirmed by the chemical reduction of the bpNDI linker with tert-butylammonium fluoride and by comparing the corresponding UV/Vis spectra (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information).
[10a] Appearance of astrong EPR signal with a g value of 2.001 for the irradiated crystalsof1 corroborates the formation of radicalanionsof bpNDI,where the radicalisonthe carbon atom (Figure 3d).
[7e] On the other hand, free bpNDI ligandsalso showedsimilar photochromic behaviour (radicalanion formation) upon UV irradiation owing to the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the pyridine nitrogen to the NDI aromatic core (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).
[7e] The PET mechanism operating in the free bpNDI linkers is supported by the fact that the diprotonated bpNDIH 2 2+ showednocolour change upon irradiation. We envisage asimilar diprotonated coordination environmentfor the bpNDI linker in framework 1 after bindingwith Cd II and, hence, it is clear that the PET mechanism in the framework is quite different from that in the free linker molecule. Hence, we believe that the PET mechanism operating in the framework shouldbeanintermolecular phenomenon, possibly between differentstrut molecules.
Thus, control experimentswereperformed to understand the possible origins of the PET pathways. Interestingly,a1:1mixture of biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdcNa 2 )with bpNDIH 2 2+ showed similar photochromic behaviour upon UV irradiation (Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information). These linkers mimic the coordination environment of the framework and the formation of the radical ion was again confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy and EPR measurements(Figures S11and S12 in the Supporting Information). It is important to note that UV irradiation of the bpNDIH 2 2+ and bpdcH 2 (1:1) mixturedid not show any photochromic behaviour.These results clearly indicate that the photochromic behaviour in such systems is indeed due to an inter-strut photoinduced electron-transfer process and in the present case it is from the bpdc to the bpNDI acceptorlinkers. This is only possible because of the perfect orientation of the struts in the framework, credited to the {Cd 2 (m 2 -OCO) 2 } n SBU and the framework interpenetration, which causes close contacts of the struts (Figure 3b and Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). The donorcomponent in this PET process can be either the carboxylate oxygen of the bpdc or the bpdc chromophoric linker itself, which are located at distances of 3.9 and 2.59 æ, respectively,from the electrondeficient bpNDI linker (Figure 3b).
[10b] Although similarphotochromic behaviour in NDI-based MOFs has been ascribed to asocalled “p–p*electron transfer”, [8d,e] we show herethat the reduction of bpNDI acceptors to radical anionswould indeed requireaPET mechanism wherein the presence of an electrondonor group/molecule is mandatory.
Host–guest chemistry in luminescentporous MOFs is of great interestasvariousbimolecular photophysical properties, such as exciplex emission, charge-transfer or energy-transfer processes,can be modulated in aunique mannerinthe constrained spacesavailable inside the frameworks.
[2,5] We further envisaged guest-induced modulation of the charge-transfer properties of this MOF with electron-deficient channels. Three different electron-richguest molecules, that is, 4,N,N-trimethylaniline (DMPT)and 1,5-/2,6-dinaphthol (1,5-/2,6-DAN), were encapsulated successfully into 1’ (1@DMPT, 1@1,5-DAN and 1@ 2,6-DAN)and striking colourchanges were immediately observed, from golden yellow to dark brown, green and dark green, respectively,suggesting ground-stateinteractions between the hostand guest chromophores (Figure 4a). The guest loading was confirmed through 1 HNMR (Figures S14– S16 in the SupportingInformation), TGA (Figure S1), PXRD (FigFigure 3. Reversible photoinduced strut-to-strut electrontransfer:a)photographs of 1 before and after UV radiation (365 nm);b)possible supramolecularinteractions between two different struts realisedbyinterpenetration (cyan =Cd II ,red =oxygen, green =Catoms of bpdc,grey = Catoms of bpNDI, blue = Nand yellow = hydrogen); c) UV/Vis time-dependentabsorbance spectra on UV irradiation;d)EPR spectraof1 (blue =1 without irradiation, black = 3min of irradiation, red = 7min of irradiation).

1 HNMR spectra of the composites were recorded on digestion with DClin[D 6 ]DMSO and confirmed that the percentages of guest loading per formulaunit are 100, 90, 98 %for 1@DMPT, 1@1,5-DAN and 1@2,6-DAN,respectively.Changes in powder diffraction patterns of 1 on encapsulation also reiteratethe successful loading of guest molecules. Furthermore, CO 2 adsorptionisotherms (Figure 2b)for guest encapsulatedcomposites 1@2,6-DAN and 1@1,5-DAN were measured at 195 K.
As expected, both of the guest-loaded frameworks do not show anyuptake of CO 2 up to 1atm, unequivocally proving that 2,6/1,5-DAN occupy the regular channel of 1.However, 1@DMPT exhibitsatype Iprofile with total CO 2 uptake of 72 cm 3 g ¢1 (2.49 CO 2 molecules per formula unit), which is smaller than that of framework 1’.Itisprobablethat as DMPT is smaller in size than 2,6/1,5-DAN, there is sufficient void space for further CO 2 inclusio n.
The dark colou rs of the three composites are indicative of ground-state charge-transfer interactions and this is distinctly reflected in the appearance of broad bands in entire visible region of the UV/Vis spectra (Figure 4b). Specifically for 1@DMPT,the bands are well resolved and the newly appeared bands at 513, 630, 728 and 792 nm can be attributed to the radical anion of bpNDI, suggesting aguest-to-host electron-transfer process. Furthermore, EPR measurements were carriedout and strong EPR signals were obtainedfor each case, clearly confirming the fact of guest-tohost electron transfer (Figure 4a). Hence, it can be stated that the occlusion of suitable guest molecules in the functionalised channels gives rise to an extended co-facial arrangementbetween the guests and the pillars of the host, hence reflecting the importance of confinementeffects in porous frameworks.
It is worth mentioningthat even after three to four months, the colour of the guest-encapsulated compoundsdonot change and the EPR signals remainthe same, suggesting longlived charge-separated states of bpNDI and guest molecules.
As the bpNDIlinker is redoxactive, electrochemical studies of frameworks 1 and 1@2,6-DAN were performed to test their chemicalchange after guest inclusion on electrodes passing electricalenergy.
[7a,11] The cyclic voltammogram of pristine bpNDI exhibits two sets of fully reversible redoxpeaks that correspond to [bpNDI] 0/ C ¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.52 Vand [bpNDI] C ¢/2¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.94 V(Figure S18 in the Supporting Information). The redox peaks obtained in the case of pure bpNDIare retained even after formation of the MOF ([bpNDI] 0/ C ¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.49 Vand [bpNDI] C ¢/2¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.94 V), confirming that 1 is aredoxactive porous framework (Table S4 in the Supporting Information and Figure 4c,inset). However,the feature is quasi-reversible in nature, unlike that of pristine bpNDI; [11] this might be due to the integrated bpNDI,electronic environmentof which is not same as that of the free ligand.Onthe other hand, drastic changes in the voltammogram of guest-encapsulated 1@2,6-DAN were observed compared with pristine bpNDI and 1 (Figure 4c). Thevery small current density of peak I([bpNDI] 0/ C ¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.49 V) compared to peak II ([bpNDI] C ¢/2¢ at E 1/2 = ¢0.91 V) suggeststhat bpNDI is in amono radical anion state formed by electron transfer from 2,6-DAN. The small current density of peak Isuggeststhat minute amountsofbpNDIs are present in the system, but are not involved in the electron-transfer process. These resultsfurther suggest the role of the included guest (2,6-DAN) in the electron-transfer process in guest-loaded framework. The high peak current for peak II can be attributed to the combination of both electrochemical reduction and chemically generated mono anion radicals ([bpNDI] 0/ C ¢ and unreduced bpNDI linker.
In the next step, the potential scan is inverted andthe presence of two anodic peaks corresponds to the oxidation of bpNDI 2¢ to bpNDI C ¢ followed by further oxidation of bpNDI C ¢ to bpNDI.
In conclusion, we have reported the synthesis and characterisationofamultichromophoric 3D interpenetrated redoxactive porous framework with unique photoinduced inter-net strut-to-strut electron-transfercharacteristics.Furthermore, electron-deficient anddynamic-coordination spacesenabled facile encapsulation of different electron-rich aromatic molecules, which results in strut-to-strut long-lived charge-separated states in the ground state. The unique ability of such multichromophoric system to encapsulate variousguest molecules with an electron-transfer response holds great promise for designing novel functional redox-activematerials. Therefore, such host materials can alter their physicaland chemical properties in the presence of guest molecules in their cavities,thereby, Figure 4. a) Encapsulation of electron-rich aromatic guestmolecules (1,5-/2,6-DAN and DMPT) in 1’ with corresponding colour change and EPR spectra(cyan= Cd II ,red = oxygen, grey = Catoms, blue =N);b)UV/Vis spectraof 1 and guest-encapsulated compounds (black= 1,blue= 1@2,6-DAN,purple =1@1,5-DAN,red = 1@DMPT (100%));c)cyclic voltammogramof1@2,6-DAN (inset: 1)in0.1m TBAP in acetonitrile at ascan rate of 50 mVs ¢1 .
